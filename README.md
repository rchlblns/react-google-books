This application was originally built while I was a student at UT Coding Bootcamp in Houston. The assignment required us to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Users also have the ability to save books and review their saved books list. 

In this revision, I improved upon my previous design by utilizing Styled Components for styling and integrating React Toastify to provide notifications to users when saving and deleting books to their database.

## Next Steps
It would be interesting to include a button that generates a random book for you, like the Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" button
